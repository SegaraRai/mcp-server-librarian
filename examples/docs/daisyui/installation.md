## daisyUI 5 install notes
[install guide](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/)
1. daisyUI 5 requires Tailwind CSS v4
2. `tailwind.config.js` file is deprecated in Tailwind CSS v4. do not use `tailwind.config.js`. Tailwind CSS v4 only needs `@import "tailwindcss";` in the CSS file if it's a node dependency.
3. daisyUI 5 can be installed using `npm i -D daisyui@latest` and then adding `@plugin "daisyui";` to the CSS file
4. daisyUI is suggested to be installed as a dependency but if you really want to use it from CDN, you can use Tailwind CSS and daisyUI CDN files:
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
```
5. A CSS file with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI looks like this (if it's a node dependency)
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "daisyui";
```
