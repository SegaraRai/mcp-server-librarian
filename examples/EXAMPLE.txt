Please create a form in examples/AgeApp.tsx that allows users to enter and view their age.

- The entered age is saved in LocalStorage and is not sent to the server.
- Style using daisyUI. Never use classes or DOM structures not documented in daisyUI. They do not exist in daisyUI.
- Documentation on coding, such as style guides, can be obtained using the librarian MCP server.
- Page layout is not required, as it will be created as one of the elements within the page.
- **Referencing local files is prohibited. Only the use of MCP tools is permitted.**
